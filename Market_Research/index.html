  <h1>Market Research</h1>
  <p>Stock market data includes large, complex datasets that update at high frequency. Along
    with my interest in trading markets it was an optimal source to develop python progmramming
    skills. Most of the code I've written is in python and can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/jdejones/market_data">market_data</a>
    repository. I don't plan to post regularly here but as most of my code is written for 
    processing market data it would be appropriate to include some of my work here.
  </p>
  <p>Some of the resources I use are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Price Data:
      <ul>
        <li><a href='https://www.polygon.io'>Polygon.io</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>LLM prompted research:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://jdejones.github.io/Market_Research/Drones/index.html">Drones</a></li>
      </ul>
