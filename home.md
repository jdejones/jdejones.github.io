# ABOUT
This site is intended to be a gateway to examples of my skills for working with 
python and large, complex datasets. It also serves as a display of my exercises in complex problem solving. This is primarily through problems I've solved using LeetCode and StrataScratch; although I've also developed a codebase for processing stock [market data](https://github.com/jdejones/market_data). You may need to create a github account, if you don't have one, to view the code. To avoid a wall of text, LeetCode problem links are now on a separate page: **[LeetCode solutions](leetcode/)**. As the purpose of these solutions is to exercise problem solving I don't use A.I. to solve the leetcode and stratascratch problems. My codebase is mostly my code combined with some code prompted. If you're unfamiliar with what LeetCode and StrataScratch are the following paragraph is an explanation.

LeetCode is a platform that provides coding problems in several languages at varying difficulties and I've used it to solve general python problems and problems with the python library pandas. StrataScratch is more ideal for solving problems with datasets; however, I found it after I started working with LeetCode and therefore have solved fewer problems on the platform.

# [Market Research](https://jdejones.github.io/Market_Research/index.html)
The link above is to a page that will contain some examples of how I process market data. It may be updated infrequently as this site isn't intended to advertise my market research. Also, the github repository for my codebase can be found here [market_data](https://github.com/jdejones/market_data)
