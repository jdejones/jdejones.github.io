# ABOUT
This site is intended to be a gateway to examples of my skills for working with 
python and large, complex datasets. It also serves as a display of my exercises in complex problem solving. This is primarily through problems I've solved using LeetCode and StrataScratch.

The following are brief descriptions of my selected repositories:
## [market data](https://github.com/jdejones/market_data)
Used for processing price and company fundamental data.
Techniques used:
- Accessing data via REST API and Websocket
- MySQL viz sqlalchemy for data storage
- Threading and multiprocessing for efficient data processing
## [News Tracker](https://github.com/jdejones/news_tracker)
Imports, processes, and stores news related data.
Techniques used:
- LLM based text summary
- GUI for displaying data via PyQT6 and Tkinter
- REST API and Websocket for importing data
- MySQL via sqlalchemy for data storage
## [Logger](https://github.com/jdejones/Logger)
Interface for centralizing logging across programs
Techniques used:
- Inheritance from python's logging module
- decorators
- Flask for local UI and real time log feed


 To avoid a wall of text, LeetCode problem links are on a separate page: **[LeetCode solutions](leetcode/)**. As the purpose of these solutions is to exercise problem solving I don't use A.I. to solve the leetcode and stratascratch problems. My codebase is mostly my code combined with some code prompted.

If you're unfamiliar with what LeetCode and StrataScratch are the following paragraph is an explanation:
LeetCode is a platform that provides coding problems in several languages at varying difficulties and I've used it to solve general python problems and problems with the python library pandas. StrataScratch is more ideal for solving problems with datasets; however, I found it after I started working with LeetCode and therefore have solved fewer problems on the platform.

# [Bioinformatics](https://github.com/jdejones/Bioinformatics_Workspace)
My bioinformatics repository includes functions made from the biopython library; for example, primer design, parsing FASTA files, and GC content calculation.

# [Market Research](https://jdejones.github.io/Market_Research/index.html)
The link above is to a page that will contain some examples of how I process market data. It may be updated infrequently as this site isn't intended to advertise my market research. Also, the github repository for my codebase can be found here [market_data](https://github.com/jdejones/market_data)
